Chicago Cubs Data Engineer Coding Challenge

For this exercise I designed code to attempt to meet a set of requirements.

One thing to note is that I decided to provide the Table names, Column names, and Data types as an explanation of my DDL. The tables were created somewhat automatically through Pandas' to_sql() method, so there were no direct DDL statements, but they should be easily reversible using these fields.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
